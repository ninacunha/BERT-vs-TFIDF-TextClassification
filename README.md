# SMS Spam Classification – CSE 4705 Final Project

This project explores how traditional machine-learning models compare to modern AI/NLP models for detecting SMS spam messages. Spam texts have become increasingly dangerous due to advances in AI-generated language, making automated detection essential for user safety.

We evaluate multiple approaches:

- **Classic ML models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting
- **Modern NLP model:** BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

Our goal is to measure how well simple text-based machine-learning models perform relative to a transformer-based language model when classifying short SMS messages

## 📊 Models Used

### **1. Classic Machine Learning Models**
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Gradient Boosting  
- XGBoost  

These models rely on TF-IDF vectorization and treat text as numeric features.

### **3. BERT (Transformer NLP Model)**
A modern deep-learning model that understands **context**, **semantics**, and **word relationships**. Used with a classification head to output spam vs. ham labels.
